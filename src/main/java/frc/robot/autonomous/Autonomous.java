/*
Quick guide to Comand Groups

SequentialComandGroup:
	Will run all comands in order within it's parentheses
	Note: If a comand does not have a isFinshed statment the code will be stuck on that command forever 

ParallelCommandGroup:
	Will run commands in parallel if they use diffrent SubSystems
	Note: Both commands will have to finish to move on

ParallelRaceGoup:
	Will run commands in parallel if they use diffrent SubSystems
	Note: As soon as one command runs it's isfinished method runs then both commands will end

ParallelDeadlineGroup
	Will run commands in parallel if they use diffrent SubSystems
	Note: Only the first command will finish the group
